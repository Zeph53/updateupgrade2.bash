github forcing the use of 2fa now. i don't own a cellphone and i won't be buying one just to create free stuff.
i won't be relying on third party password managers, or less-than-functional authentication apps either.

it was an interesting run on gitHub for like 7 years. 
not a single comment, reaction, issue report, star, feedback of any kind..
still tried sending things out there..

if i can't access any of the stuff that i've made due to github's forcing of 2fa, then none of you can either.




## UPDATEUPGRADE2

This is a Bash script that allows users to run various update and upgrade commands automatically and 
without a lot of human interaction, or notification about warnings or incompatibilities. Best used in an enterprise environment, with a proprietary list of repositories, or those on a rolling repository.

There is a chance that DPKG will create a lock-up issue with APT, without telling you, in such case it is safe to assume that your PC is now broken and there is nothing I can think of right now to fix it. 

As root/SUDO user, try to run "/bin/bash -i -c 'dpkg --configure -a'", just like it says..
